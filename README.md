# Rust Tutorials

## Classwork 1

1. Write a rust program that prints your fullname and in this format `My name is [first_name] [last_name]`
2. In thesame program print your age, the country you're from and your birthday.
3. Do these in two different projects, 
   1. The first one should be called `my_name_without_cargo` and it should be compiled without the use of cargo
   2. The second should be called `my_name_with_cargo` and it should be compiled with cargo 

**Goodluck!**
